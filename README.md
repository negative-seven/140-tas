### Instructions ###  
There needs to be an input file for each level: `tas_script_0.txt` through `tas_script_4.txt`, which should be in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\140`.  
First value is how many frames, the other values are the inputs, all seperated by commas.  
You can start the line with a `#` for it to be a comment.  
if the line only has a number it'll wait for this number of frames.
